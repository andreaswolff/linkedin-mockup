# LinkedIn Clone

This project is built using React for the UI, Redux to manage the application state and Firebase on the backend for authentication and database needs.

# Is the Live Demo not working?

If you encounter this issue, it is because someone reported/keeps reporting the clone as PHISHING on Google Cloud Platform and it gets taken down automatically whilst the verification process takes up to a week so I can get it back up and running, I assume that is due to the fact that I have a Google Auth feature on it, even though I provided some 'demo accounts' at the sign-up screen and called it a LinkedIn Clone/Mockup.

That being said, you can take a look at/download the repository above.

Thank you.
